### Tips and Tricks
 
- You can burn multiple copies of the same CD timecode if you want to have backups or use them on different CDJs.
- You can also use other software such as Nero or Roxio to burn ISO files to CDs, but make sure you choose the option to burn as an image file and not as a data file.
- You can test your CD timecode by playing it on your CDJ and checking if it syncs with your Traktor software. You should see a green LED on your Traktor interface indicating that the timecode signal is detected.
- You can adjust the sensitivity and latency of your timecode signal in the Traktor preferences under *Timecode Setup*.
