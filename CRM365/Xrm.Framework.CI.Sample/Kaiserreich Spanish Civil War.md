The Spanish Civil War was a complex and bloody conflict that erupted in Spain in 1936, following a coup attempt by a coalition of right-wing forces led by General Miguel Primo de Rivera. The coup was opposed by a diverse array of left-wing and republican factions, as well as regional nationalists, who formed a loose alliance known as the Popular Front. The war was also influenced by the international context of the Second Weltkrieg, as different foreign powers intervened on both sides of the conflict.

In the Kaiserreich timeline, the Spanish Civil War has some similarities and differences with its historical counterpart. The main difference is that Spain did not experience a dictatorship under Primo de Rivera in the 1920s, as he was assassinated by an anarchist in 1923. Instead, Spain remained under the constitutional monarchy of Alfonso XIII, who presided over a corrupt and unstable political system known as Turnismo. This system involved two parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, alternating in power through electoral fraud and patronage. The system was challenged by various social movements, such as the anarchists, socialists, syndicalists, republicans, regionalists, and Carlists.
 
The Carlists were a traditionalist and reactionary movement that advocated for a different branch of the Bourbon dynasty to rule Spain. They had fought three civil wars in the 19th century against the liberal governments of Madrid, and maintained a strong presence in some regions of northern Spain. In Kaiserreich, they are led by Carlos VIII, who claims to be the legitimate king of Spain. The Carlists are allied with the Integralists, a Catholic and nationalist movement that seeks to restore the medieval fueros (local privileges) and create a confederation of autonomous regions under a strong monarchy.
 
The trigger for the civil war in Kaiserreich was the death of Alfonso XIII in 1936. His son and heir, Alfonso XIV, was seen as too weak and liberal by many sectors of the army and the right-wing parties. A group of generals led by Primo de Rivera's son, JosÃ© Antonio Primo de Rivera, launched a coup against the new king, hoping to establish a fascist dictatorship inspired by Italy's National Populist regime. The coup was supported by some conservative and monarchist groups, as well as by Germany and Italy.
 
The coup failed to seize control of most of the country, as it faced resistance from various forces loyal to the king or opposed to fascism. The Popular Front was formed by the socialists, syndicalists, republicans, and regionalists, who declared a democratic republic and sought to implement social reforms and autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque Country. The Popular Front was supported by France and Britain, who saw it as a potential ally against Germany. The Carlists also rose up against the coup, declaring their own kingdom in Navarre and expanding their control over parts of Aragon and Castile. The Carlists were supported by Portugal and Brazil, who shared their Integralist ideology.

The civil war lasted for three years, with shifting alliances and fronts. The main battles were fought in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Zaragoza, Valencia, Seville, and Malaga. The war also involved naval and aerial warfare, as well as guerrilla tactics and terror attacks. The war caused massive casualties and devastation, as well as atrocities committed by all sides. The war ended in 1939 with a stalemate between the three factions: the Popular Front controlled most of the south and east of Spain; the Carlists controlled most of the north and west; and the fascists controlled a small enclave around Madrid. A peace treaty was signed in Lisbon, dividing Spain into three zones of influence under international supervision.
 
The Kaiserreich Spanish Civil War is one of the most fascinating and tragic episodes of alternative history. It shows how different political ideologies and foreign interventions can shape the fate of a nation and its people.
