The program has four tabs: ISO/PBP File, Output PBP folder, Game Settings and Options.
 
## Step 4: Select your PS2 game
 
Click on the [...] icon next to ISO/PBP File and browse for your PS2 game file. It can be an ISO, BIN or IMG file. If your game has multiple BIN files, you need to select the one that has the largest size and contains the data track of the game.
 
## Step 5: Select your output folder
 
Click on the [...] icon next to Output PBP folder and choose a folder where you want to save your converted PSP eboot. The program will automatically create a subfolder with the game ID (for example, SLUS1234) inside the output folder.
 
## Step 6: Edit your game settings
 
The program will automatically fill in some information about your game, such as title, ID and region. You can leave them as they are or edit them manually if you want. You can also change the game icon (usually the cover art) and background by clicking on the [...] icons next to them and choosing an image file from your computer. The images should be squared and have a resolution of 144x80 pixels for the icon and 480x272 pixels for the background.
 
## Step 7: Adjust your options
 
Click on the Options tab and set your preferences for the conversion process. You can choose the compression level (from 0 to 9), which affects the size and quality of your eboot. We recommend you set it to 1, which is a good balance between compression and performance. You can also choose whether to use custom or classic gameboot (the animation that plays when you launch a game) and whether to save or delete source files after conversion.
 
## Step 8: Convert your game
 
When you are ready, click on Convert and wait for the program to finish converting your game. Depending on the size and compression level of your game, this may take a few minutes or longer.
