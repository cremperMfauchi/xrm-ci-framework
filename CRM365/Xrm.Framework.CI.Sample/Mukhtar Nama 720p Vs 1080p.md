## 720p vs 1080p: What's the Difference?
 
The 720p and 1080p are two common video resolutions that indicate the number of pixels on the screen. The more pixels there are, the clearer and sharper the image will be. The 720p resolution has 1280x720 pixels, while the 1080p resolution has 1920x1080 pixels. This means that the 1080p resolution has about twice as many pixels as the 720p resolution.
 
However, this does not mean that the 1080p resolution is always better than the 720p resolution. There are other factors that affect the quality of the video, such as the size of the screen, the distance from the screen, the source of the video, and the bandwidth of the internet connection. For example, if you are watching Mukhtar Nama on a small screen or from a far distance, you may not notice much difference between the two resolutions. Similarly, if you are watching Mukhtar Nama from a low-quality source or with a slow internet connection, you may experience buffering issues or long loading times with the 1080p resolution.
 
## Which Resolution Should You Choose?
 
The answer to this question depends on your personal preference and situation. If you have a large screen and a fast internet connection, and you want to enjoy the best possible quality of Mukhtar Nama, you may opt for the 1080p resolution. However, if you have a small screen or a slow internet connection, or you are not too concerned about the quality of Mukhtar Nama, you may choose the 720p resolution.

## Who is Mukhtar al-Thaqafi?
 
Mukhtar al-Thaqafi was a Shia Muslim leader who lived in the 7th century CE. He was born in Kufa, Iraq, and belonged to the Thaqif tribe. He was a loyal follower of Imam Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, and the first Shia Imam. He also supported Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn, the second and third Shia Imams, respectively.
 
After the tragic martyrdom of Imam Husayn and his companions in the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi rose up against the Umayyad dynasty, which was responsible for the massacre. He led a rebellion in Kufa and declared himself as the representative of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam and the son of Imam Zayn al-Abidin, the fourth Shia Imam and the only survivor of Karbala. He fought against the Umayyad forces and killed many of their leaders, including Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, the governor of Kufa who ordered the killing of Imam Husayn.
 
Mukhtar al-Thaqafi was a brave and righteous leader who sought justice and vengeance for the oppressed Ahlulbayt (the family of Prophet Muhammad). He established a government based on Islamic principles and provided security and welfare for his followers. He was also a scholar and a poet who composed many verses in praise of Imam Ali and Imam Husayn. He died in 687 CE when his army was defeated by Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, the brother of Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, a rival claimant to the caliphate.
