1. Check if there are any updates or patches for FIFA 13 from the game developer's website. If available, download and install them and see if that resolves the issue.
2. Temporarily disable any antivirus software that you have installed on your computer and check if the error persists. Some antivirus software may falsely detect and quarantine the rld.dll file as a threat and prevent it from loading. If disabling your antivirus software fixes the error, you may need to add an exception for the rld.dll file or FIFA 13 in your antivirus settings.
3. Run a system file checker tool to scan and repair any corrupted or missing system files on your computer. The system file checker tool is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. To run the system file checker tool, follow these steps:
    - Press Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin) from the menu.
    - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter.
    - Wait for the scan to complete and restart your computer.
4. Reinstall FIFA 13 on your computer and make sure that you install it in a different location than before. Sometimes, reinstalling the game can fix any installation errors or missing files that may cause the rld.dll error.
5. Download a new copy of the rld.dll file from a reliable source and replace it in the FIFA 13 folder. You can find the FIFA 13 folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA 13 by default. Before you download a new copy of the rld.dll file, make sure that you scan it with your antivirus software and back up the original file in case you need to restore it later.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the error "The dynamic library rld.dll failed to load" when playing FIFA 13 and enjoy your game without any interruptions. However, if none of these steps work for you, you may need to contact EA Sports customer support for further assistance.
