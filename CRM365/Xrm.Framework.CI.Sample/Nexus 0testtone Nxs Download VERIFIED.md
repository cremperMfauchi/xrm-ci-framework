## What is 0TestTone.nxs?
 
0TestTone.nxs is a file that Nexus uses to test the sound output of your system. It is not a sound library or an expansion pack, but a simple test tone that Nexus plays when it starts up. If Nexus cannot find this file, it will ask you to locate it manually. However, this file is not included in the original installation of Nexus, so you will not be able to find it on your computer.
 
## Why does Nexus ask for 0TestTone.nxs?
 
There are two main reasons why Nexus may ask for 0TestTone.nxs:
 
- You have a cracked version of Nexus. Some cracked versions of Nexus have modified the original files and replaced them with fake ones. These fake files may cause Nexus to malfunction and ask for 0TestTone.nxs.
- You have installed an expansion pack incorrectly. Some expansion packs for Nexus require you to copy some files to the Nexus folder or to replace some existing files. If you do this incorrectly, you may overwrite or delete some important files that Nexus needs to run properly, such as 0TestTone.nxs.

If you still get the error message after reinstalling Nexus and installing your expansion packs correctly, you can try to download the file 0TestTone.nxs from a reliable source and place it in the Nexus folder.
