## The History and Legacy of Roland PCM Synths
  
PCM stands for pulse-code modulation, a method of converting analog audio signals into digital data. PCM synths use samples of real instruments or sounds as the basis for their waveforms, which can then be manipulated by filters, envelopes, LFOs, and other synthesis parameters.
  
Roland was one of the pioneers of PCM synthesis, starting with the EP-30 electronic piano in 1974, which used touch-sensitive keys to trigger different samples of piano sounds. In 1978, Roland introduced the CR-68 and CR-78 rhythm machines, which used PCM samples of drums and percussion to create realistic and programmable patterns.
  
But it was in the 1980s that Roland really made its mark with PCM synths, launching a series of influential and innovative products that shaped the sound of pop music. Some of the most notable ones include:
  
- The D-50 (1987), which combined PCM samples with digital synthesis to create complex and expressive sounds. It was one of the first synths to use linear arithmetic (LA) synthesis, which blended sampled attack transients with synthesized sustain and release phases. The D-50 also featured a built-in digital effects processor and a joystick controller for real-time modulation.
- The U-110 (1988), which was a rack-mounted sound module that offered 16-part multitimbral playback of PCM samples. It had six ROM cards slots for expanding its sound library, which covered a wide range of acoustic and electric instruments. The U-110 was also compatible with Roland's R8 drum machine and S-series samplers.
- The MT-32 (1987), which was a desktop sound module that became popular among computer musicians and gamers. It used LA synthesis to generate 32 voices of polyphony and 8 parts of multitimbrality. It had a built-in reverb unit and a MIDI interface that allowed it to communicate with PCs and other MIDI devices. The MT-32 was widely used for creating music and sound effects for PC games in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
- The JV-80 (1992), which was a keyboard synth that introduced Roland's concept of wave expansion. It had four expansion slots for adding new PCM waveforms and patches, which could be selected from a large LCD screen. The JV-80 also had a powerful effects section, a velocity-sensitive keyboard with aftertouch, and a performance mode that allowed up to four patches to be layered or split.

These are just some examples of Roland's PCM synths, which spanned several generations and product lines. Roland's PCM technology evolved over the years, incorporating new features such as sample playback, resynthesis, physical modeling, vector synthesis, and more. Roland's PCM synths have been used by countless artists across various genres, such as Depeche Mode, Enya, Jean-Michel Jarre, Michael Jackson, Prince, Vangelis, and many more.
