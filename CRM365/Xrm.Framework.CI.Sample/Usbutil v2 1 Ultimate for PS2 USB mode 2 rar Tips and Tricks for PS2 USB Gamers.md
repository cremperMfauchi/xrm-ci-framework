## Step 2: Create PS2 ISOs for USB Mode 2
 
Now that you have opened Usbutil v2.1 Ultimate, you can start creating PS2 ISOs for USB mode 2. There are two ways to do this: from DVD or from ISO.
 
If you have a PS2 game disc that you want to convert, you can use the option "Create game from CD/DVD". You will need to insert the disc into your PC's DVD drive and select it as the source. Then, you will need to choose a destination folder where the ISO file will be saved. You can also change the name of the ISO file if you want. Finally, click on "Create" and wait for the process to finish.
 
If you already have a PS2 ISO file that you want to convert, you can use the option "Create game from ISO". You will need to browse and select the ISO file as the source. Then, you will need to choose a destination folder where the new ISO file will be saved. You can also change the name of the new ISO file if you want. Finally, click on "Create" and wait for the process to finish.
 
Both methods will create a new ISO file that is compatible with USB mode 2. The new ISO file will have a prefix "\_usb" in its name to indicate that it is for USB mode 2.
 
## Step 3: Transfer PS2 ISOs to USB Drive
 
After you have created your PS2 ISOs for USB mode 2, you can transfer them to your USB flash drive or hard disk. You will need to format your USB drive as FAT32 before transferring any files. You can use a program like HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool or Rufus to do this.
 
Once your USB drive is formatted as FAT32, you can copy and paste your PS2 ISOs to it. You can create folders to organize your games if you want. The only requirement is that the folders and files must not have spaces or special characters in their names.
 
When you have finished transferring your PS2 ISOs to your USB drive, you can safely eject it from your PC and plug it into your PS2 console.
 
## Step 4: Play PS2 Games from USB Drive
 
Now that you have your PS2 games on your USB drive, you can play them on your PS2 console. You will need a USB loader installed on your PS2 console, such as Open PS2 Loader (OPL) or Free McBoot (FMCB). You can find tutorials on how to install these loaders online.
