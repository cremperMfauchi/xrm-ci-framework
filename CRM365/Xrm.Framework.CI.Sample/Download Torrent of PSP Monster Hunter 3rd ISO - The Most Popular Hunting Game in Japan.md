## Tips and Tricks for Monster Hunter Portable 3rd
 
Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is not an easy game, especially for beginners. You will need to learn the basics of hunting, such as tracking, attacking, dodging, using items, and managing your stamina. You will also need to know the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon type, as well as the habits and patterns of each monster. To help you out, here are some tips and tricks that can make your hunting experience more enjoyable and successful:

- Always bring enough supplies for your quest. You will need potions, antidotes, whetstones, paintballs, traps, bombs, and other items depending on the situation. You can buy them from the shop or craft them from materials you gather. You can also get some free items from the blue box at the start of each quest.
- Always eat before you go on a quest. You can eat at the canteen in your home or at the campsite. Eating will give you various buffs, such as increased health, stamina, attack, defense, or elemental resistance. You can also unlock new dishes and ingredients by completing certain quests or gathering certain items.
- Always upgrade your equipment whenever you can. You can upgrade your weapons and armor at the blacksmith in the village. Upgrading will improve their stats and abilities, as well as unlock new skills and slots. You will need money and materials to upgrade your equipment, which you can get by completing quests or carving monsters.
- Always learn the moves and patterns of each monster. Each monster has its own behavior, attacks, weaknesses, and breakable parts. You can use the hunter's notes in your menu to check their information, or use websites like [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/991479-monster-hunter-portable-3rd/faqs/61711) [^1^] or [RPG Only](https://rpgonly.com/monster-hunter-portable-3rd-english-patched-psp-iso-1/) [^2^] to find more detailed guides and walkthroughs. You can also use paintballs to mark their location on the map, or use sonic bombs or flash bombs to stun them or make them drop items.
- Always cooperate with your teammates if you play online or with felyne comrades. You can communicate with other players using chat messages or gestures. You can also use signals to alert them of danger or request help. You can customize your felyne comrades' equipment and skills at the board in your home. You can also train them at the dojo or send them on quests at the farm.

Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is a game that rewards skill, patience, and preparation. By following these tips and tricks, you can improve your hunting skills and enjoy the game more. Happy hunting!
