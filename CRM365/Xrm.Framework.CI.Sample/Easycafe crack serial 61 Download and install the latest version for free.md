To use this device in a multiuser environment, you need to have Microsoft Windows Server installed on the host computer and obtain the appropriate client access licenses (CALs) for each user. These licenses are required by Microsoft to access the server resources and applications. You can use NComputing products with different versions of Microsoft Windows Server, such as 2008, 2012, 2016 or 2019.

If you want to use the X550 NComputing device for single user applications, such as one-to-one virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), display systems or remote access, you do not need Microsoft Windows Server or CALs. However, you need to have a desktop operating system installed on the host computer, such as Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft Windows 8 or Microsoft Windows 10. Please note that home versions of these operating systems are NOT supported by NComputing products.
  
The X550 NComputing device consists of a PCI card that connects to the host computer and five access devices that connect to the monitors, keyboards and mice of the users.

Each access device supports resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 or 1440 x 900.
